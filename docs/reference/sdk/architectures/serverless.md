# Serverless

For serverless environments, we recommend to stick to the patterns
mentioned in [Multi Instance Services](./multi-instance-services.md).

We especially recommend two patterns described there for serverless environments:

- Fast read storage as primary storage: [Fast Primary Storage](./multi-instance-services.md#fast-primary-storage)
- Distributed cache and locking mechanism: [Distributed Cache and Locks](./multi-instance-services.md#distributed-cache-and-locks)
