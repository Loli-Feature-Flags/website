# SDK

The Loli Feature Flag JavaScript/TypeScript SDK is the core piece of Loli Feature Flags. It
- defines the schema of Loli specifications,
- exposes validation functionality,
- exposes low-level functions to work with specifications,
- exposes low-level functions to evaluate feature flags, and segments,
- and exposes a higher-level [client](./client/index) interface to conveniently load a specification and evaluate feature flags.
