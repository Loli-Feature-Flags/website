# Condition Set Condition

A condition set condition enables evaluating a subset of conditions â€“ a sub [Condition Set](../condition-set.md).
This allows nesting condition sets that have different condition set operators allowing to for example mix
`and`, `or` sets.

The condition will evaluate to `true`, if the condition set evaluates to `true`.
