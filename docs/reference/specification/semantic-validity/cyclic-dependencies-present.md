# Cyclic Dependencies Present

This issue type is denoted by the type `SemanticIssueType.CYCLIC_DEPENDENCIES_PRESENT`.

Such an issue is detected whenever a schema entity references another entity that is directly part of/causing
a cyclic dependency.

An example:
- (a) Feature flag `F1` references segment `S1`. **(contains a cyclic dependency)**
- (b) Segment `S1` references segment `S2`.
- (c) Segment `S2` references segment `S1`. (back to (b), cyclic dependency)

The difference to the semantic issue [Entity Part Of Cyclic Dependency](./entity-part-of-cyclic-dependency.md) is
that an entity an issue of type `SemanticIssueType.CYCLIC_DEPENDENCIES_PRESENT` is created for does
not directly cause the cyclic dependencies, but only "contains" one.

## Issues Example

This is the same example shown as in [Entity Part Of Cyclic Dependency](./entity-part-of-cyclic-dependency.md#issues-example),
but here only the issue type `SemanticIssueType.CYCLIC_DEPENDENCIES_PRESENT` is highlighted in the schema.
