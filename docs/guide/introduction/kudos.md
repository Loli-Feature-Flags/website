# Kudos

Loli Feature Flags exists because other people have created awesome open-source/free software, tools, and libraries
that Loli Feature Flags is built on.

And, some services are free for open source software to give something back to the open source community.

**To every service/library/package/software listed here: Thank you very much! ❤️**

Unfortunately, we can't write (at least manually) a Kudos message for every library
that is being used (even implicitly via peer dependencies, etc.).

## Codecov

[Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/) is an excellent service executing tests and providing code coverage reports, badges, etc.
It is free for open source software. And we love that and are using it to create code coverage reports
for Loli libraries.

## Cuid(2)

Loli UI uses the NPM package `cuid2` to create new IDs for new
Loli specification entities (feature flags, segments, properties).

## ESLint

We use ESLint to enforce a standard code style across our repos.

Link: https://eslint.org/

## GitHub

All of our repositories are hosted on GitHub. We also have a GitHub organization
for all the repos, which is free for open source software.

## Jest

Jest is a test runner that we use to execute tests that make sure our code works like intended.

## NPM

With NPM we specifically mean the package registry where our packages/artifacts are uploaded to, so
that you can easily install them in your projects.

## Pinia

Pinia is an awesome store management library that we use for Loli UI to manage UI wide state.

## Prettier

Prettier is used to enforce a common code style.

## Radix Vue

Radix Vue is a collection of headless and accessible UI components that is used by Loli UI
to render nearly all UI elements. It has reduced the workload tremendously.

## Tailwind

Tailwind CSS powers the styling of Loli UI and saved so much time when developing a
good-looking Loli UI.

## TypeScript

Our projects are written in TypeScript. It makes our lives easier and allows you to use
the Loli packages in your TypeScript packages with full type support as well.

## Vite

Loli UI is a Vite project. Vite makes it also so easy to build a Vue library (NPM package as well as CDN UMD, and ESM builds).

Vite is also implicitly powering our docs (Vitepress).

## Vitepress

Our docs/website is created with Vitepress. An excellent tool that is opinionated, yet very flexible and customizable
allowing to create/write docs very fast.

We would not go back to another documentation tool.

## Vue

We love Vue! It made creating our pluggable Loli UI very easy and development time was very low due to
Vue's excellent developer centric syntax.

## VueDraggable (SortableJS)

Loli UI uses VueDraggable to achieve drag and drop with very low development effort.

VueDraggable is a Vue wrapper around SortableJS.

## Zod

Zod, probably the greatest invention of recent JS/TS history. Zod powers our Loli specification schema
definition and schema validation.

Without Zod, the Loli specification schema would have been a real pain – especially the validation
of a deeply nested and recursive structure.
