# Kudos

Loli Feature Flags exists because other people have created awesome open-source/free software, tools, and libraries
that Loli Feature Flags is built on.

We to give kudos to the most important ones here.

Unfortunately, we can't write (at least manually) a Kudos message to every library (*cough* `node_modules` *cough*)
that is being used (even implicitly).
