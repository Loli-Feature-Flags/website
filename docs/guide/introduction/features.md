# Features

Loli Feature Flags is a very feature rich feature flagging toolkit that can easily
compete with paid feature flag systems that are available on the market. 

Based on how Loli Feature Flags is built – that you own the specification – some features can not be
supported natively (like auditing/"Who changed what?"). But such features can be easily implemented with a tiny
bit of effort from your side.

## Fully supported features

The following features are natively supported:
- Targeting
- Kill switch
- Gradual rollouts

- Serverless compatibility
- Distributed systems compatibility
- Typesafe evaluation context/user properties

- Array user properties
